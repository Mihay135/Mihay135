<p>*Just an Italian/Romanian tech enthusiast diving into the world of coding as a software developer! 🚀*

Hailing from Romania 🇷🇴 I made my way to the beautiful land of Italy 🇮🇹 when I was very young. I’m a curious learner passionate about exploring the vast universe of technology, from building dynamic web apps to crafting sleek Java GUIs . I’m on a mission to soak up as much knowledge as possible before mastering my favorite tech stacks!</p>

- 🔥 **Passion**: Diving deep into various technologies to find my niche in the tech world💻.
- 🎮 **Hobbies**: In my free time I like reading books📚 (fantasy/adventure or sci-fi), drawing✏️ (I do "Inktober" each year) and playing videogames🎲 (RTS or RPG). 
- 💡 **Fun Facts**: I'm a dog🐶 person, although I took care of far more cats🐈 in my life. I probably drink too much tea while debugging code 🍵.
