<p>*Just an Italian/Romanian tech enthusiast diving into the world of coding as a software developer! 🚀*

Hailing from Romania 🇷🇴 I made my way to the beautiful land of Italy 🇮🇹 when I was very young. I’m a curious learner passionate about exploring the vast universe of technology, from crafting sleek Java GUIs to building dynamic web apps. I’m on a mission to soak up as much knowledge as possible before mastering my favorite tech stacks!</p>

## 🌟 About Me

- 📍 **Location**: Italy 🇮🇹
- 🎓 **Background**: IT University Student recently started mastering GitHub and GitHub Desktop to share my coding adventures.
- 🔥 **Passion**: Diving deep into various technologies to find my niche in the tech world💻.
- 🎮 **Hobbies**: In my free time I like reading books📚 (fantasy/adventure or sci-fi), drawing✏️ (I do "Inktober" each year) and playing videogames🎲 (RTS or RPG). 
- 💡 **Fun Facts**: I'm a dog🐶 person, although I took care of far more cats🐈 in my life. I probably drink too much tea while debugging code 🍵.

## 🛠️ Tech I’m Exploring

I’m currently juggling a variety of technologies to broaden my skills which until now contain the following:

- **Backend**: Java, Java Spring/Boot, C# (base), SQL

- **Spoken Languages**: Romanian (Native) 🇷🇴, Italian (C2) 🇮🇹, English (C1) 🇬🇧, French (B1) 🇫🇷, Dutch (A1) 🇳🇱

I’m all about learning by doing, so expect to see a mix of projects showcasing these skills!
